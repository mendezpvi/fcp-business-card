## *What I learned* 🤓

📌 Shorthands

📌 Web-safe fonts

📌 Color palettes

📌 Flex child containers

📌 Image alt texts
+ Make your site accessible.
+ Fallback if the image doesn't render properly.
+ Helps your site rank higher on Google.
+ Don't include ***"image of"***.
+ Be concise (< 125 characters).
+ Describe it *"over the phone"*.

📌 Inheritance
+ Write DRYer code.
+ Fewer bugs.
+ Be more efficient.

📌 Utility class
+ It's iqual a class for a single CSS property,

📌 Relative path syntax
+ `./` ➡️ Start from the same directory the current file is in.
+ `../` ➡️ Start from the parent directory of (the directory "above") the current file.
+ `/` ➡️ Start from the project's root directory.

📌 Git
+ Version control system.
+ Runs locally on your own machine.
+ Helps keep a history of changes you've made to your project.

📌 GitHub
+ Online platform that stores Git repositories.
+ Runs online in the cloud.
+ Helps share your code (and the history of changes) with others.
+ Assumes the usage of the Git version control system.
+ Has many Git-based capabilities built into it (committing, merging, branching, etc.).

📌 Version Control
+ Creates *"save points"* (called **Commits**) in your code that you can revert back to if needed.
+ Manages changes made by others by **"merging"** multiple different versions of the same codebase.
+ Generally allows you to be less worried about making mistakes or having your code conflict with other people working on the same project.
